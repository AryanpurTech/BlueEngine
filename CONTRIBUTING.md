# Contibuting guidelines

As an open source project, the community is the backbone of the engine. As such, any contribution is welcome. Here are some ways you can contribute:

* `Writing features`: Adding features and functionality to the engine.
* `Writing plugins`: Adding external functionality and compatibility with various tools through plugin authorship
* `Writing examples`: Came across a cool idea? why not add it as an example for others to see and use.
* `Writing tutorials`: Knowledgebase is important, but tutorials and usage guides are important as well. This is an area the engine lacks a lot and would appreciate help the most!
* `Writing documentation`: The codebase move fast, often times documentation is forgotten to be added until a few versions.
