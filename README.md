## About

Blue Engine is a general-purpose, easy-to-use, extendable, and portable graphics engine written in rust. The engine can run on many popular back-end APIs including Vulkan, D3D-12, GL-ES 3, and Metal as well as Windows, Linux, Mobile, and OSX to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

Hello World:

```rust
use blue_engine::{
    header::{
        Engine, ObjectSettings, WindowDescriptor
    },
    primitive_shapes::triangle
};

fn main() {
    // initialize the engine
    let mut engine = Engine::new(WindowDescriptor::default()).expect("win");

    // create a triangle
    triangle("my triangle", ObjectSettings::default(), &mut engine).unwrap();

    // run the engine
    engine
        .update_loop(move |_, _, _, _, _, _| {})
        .expect("Error during update loop");
}
