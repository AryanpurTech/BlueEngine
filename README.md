# Blue Engine

Blue Engine is a general-purpose, easy-to-use, fast, extendable, secure, and portable graphics engine written in rust. The engine can run on many popular back-end APIs including Vulkan, D3D-12, GL-ES 3, and Metal as well as Windows, Linux, and OSX/MacOS (needs testing, start an issue if you can help testing) to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
