# Blue Engine utilities

## What is it?

This crate is a collection of utilities that can aid your development with the [Blue Engine](https://github.com/AryanpurTech/BlueEngine). They were separated from engine and turned into a crate instead of being integrated with the engine to have them as optional dependency than actual engine. This leads to the engine itself being smaller, cleaner, and more general focused.
